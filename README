"Create METS DIP.xml" goes in /etc/archivematica/MCPServer/mcpModulesConfig/

"createMETSDIP.sh" and "createMETSDIP.rb" go in /usr/lib/archivematica/MCPClient/clientScripts/

/etc/archivematica/MCPClient/archivematicaClientModules should contain:
createMETSDIP_v0.0 = %clientScriptsDirectory%createMETSDIP.sh

/var/archivematica/sharedDirectory/watchedDirectories/createMETSDIP/ should 
exist

Prepare AIP (or a microservice with similar output) should use createMETSDIP as its success directory.
